        <h2>My mission</h2>
        <p>
            Skillable is a platform that helps you to keep track of your skills and knowledge. 
            I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn and grow, and that 
            it should be easy to keep track of your progress. I want to help you to reach your 
            goals and to make it easier for you to show your skills to the world.

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jakub and I am an Information Technology student. I am passionate about
            programming and I love to learn new things. I created Skillable as a project to
            help me to learn new technologies, improve my skills and to help others to do the same.
